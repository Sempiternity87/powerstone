# powerstone
A mod for Minecraft that gives the ability of laying down dusts in the world made from other materials. Each dust would have a unique ability, but have similar qualities to Redstone Dust.

# New Items
* Lapis Dust      - Maybe something with experience orbs?
* Prismarine Dust - Mixed with Redstone Dust for recipe. Acts like Redstone Dust, but water doesn't break it.
* Ender Dust      - Allow for teleportation/fast travel when using an ender pearl on the line. Should there be a distance calculation? e.g. one pearl grants 64 blocks of travel, before another is used automatically. If none remain in inventory, travel ends at end of that 64 blocks or, if a torch is within range, drop out of travel at torch.
* Ender Torch     - Defines a destination for Ender Dust, activated with a redstone signal. If more than one signal activated, farthest will be used (allows for having a torch on two ends of the dust line,  for two-way travel).
* Blaze Dust      - Line of constant flame while activated with a redstone signal?
Coal/Charcoal Dust/Gunpowder - Fuse that burns along it's line (smoke particles to show path), and can ignite TNT or Nether Portals.
* Glowstone Dust  - Line of light (only a range of eight). Recipe: Mixed with Redstone Dust (since redstone powers glostone, it makes sense right?)
* (Nether) Star Dust ?
